### Project-Mental Health Resources and Recommendations for Middle-Aged Women

My project will focus on designing a platform for middle-aged women to be connected with mental health resources that will help relieve stress in their day-to-day lives. I want users to be able to select their stressor, such as having difficulties at work, or taking care of their kids, and be directed to relevant mental health recommendations such as meditation practices or self-care checklists.
