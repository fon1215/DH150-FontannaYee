## Assignment 1-Heuristic Evaluation
### Project-Mental Health Resources and Recommendations for Middle-Aged Women

My project will focus on designing a platform for middle-aged women to be connected with mental health resources that will help relieve stress in their day-to-day lives. I want users to be able to select their stressor, such as having difficulties at work, or taking care of their kids, and be directed to relevant mental health recommendations such as meditation practices or self-care checklists.

Website 1: Mindful

https://www.mindful.org/

Mindful is a mindfulness website that provides an introduction to mindfulness and suggests various activities to do based on your mental health goals or your age. As a whole, the website is very cluttered and confusing to navigate, and it’s extremely difficult to find consistency among the various pages, as many headlines are misleading, and there is a lot of irrelevant information. 


1. Visibility of system status 
	Always keep users informed about what is going on.
	Provide appropriate feedback within reasonable time. 

Evaluation (Rating: 1)
This website on a whole maintains good visibility of system status, as there are not that many complexities other that navigating through webpages, and each webpage loads quickly. However, the website also includes embedded meditation audio clips on some pages. When the audio clips are playing, there is no way of seeing exactly how much time is left in the meditation, which could possibly frustrate users as they have no idea of when the mediation will come to an end. A simple solution would be to embedding timestamps so users know how much time is left in the exercise. 


2. Match between system and the real world 
	Speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. 
	Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order. 

Evaluation (Rating: 3)
This website violates this heuristic by not making information appear in a natural and logical order. Both the “Getting Started” tab and the “Meditation” tab contain information about mindfulness, but they are grouped in separate web pages. Children’s health is covered separately in both “Getting Started” and “Health,” without a single coherent page on children’s mental health. Because of this, it is extremely difficult to find all the information you need on one page. To solve this problem, I would figure out whether to group information by mental health issues, age, or relationship status, and not use all three methods. I would then group all relevant information into the same page. 

3. User control and freedom 
	Users often choose system functions by mistake.
	Provide a clearly marked "out" to leave an unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. 
	Support undo and redo. 

Evaluation (No Issue)
I believe that this website has relatively good user control. If a user clicks on a page by accident, they can always click the back button to go back to their previous page. If they started a Youtube video or meditation clip they did not intend to, it is easy to pause. It is very easy to exit out of the situation the user does not want to be in. 

4. Consistency and standards 
	Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. 
	Follow platform conventions. 

Evaluation (Rating: 3)
This website violates this heuristic because every single page looks different from the previous one, and there is no consistent template that the user can become accustomed to. Some webpages open in a new tab while other pages do not, which makes it difficult for the user to predict what will happen when they open a page. Some pages have a vertical layout, where users simply scroll from top to bottom, while other pages have multiple boxes linking to external articles. Some topics have entirely audio meditation clips, while others have video meditation clips. I would address these issues by maintaining a consistent layout for each page and including both audio and video clips for each page. 

5. Error prevention 
	Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. 

Evaluation (No Issue)
This website has good error prevention. When users want to start a subscription, the interface will let them know clearly if their emails or other personal information was entered incorrectly, prompting the user to correct it. 

6. Recognition rather than recall 
	Make objects, actions, and options visible. 
	User should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. 
	Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate. 

Evaluation (Rating: 1) 
In this website, each tab has a dropdown menu to display the pages within each category, which is a good use of recognition. However, this website also violates this heuristic by not including the header bar in every page once you leave the main page. Because of this, in certain pages it is difficult to figure out how to navigate to other pages because the prompts are not listed at the top. In addition, the mindfulness pages have headers at the top that can take you to a specific section, which is good, but after scrolling down, the headers become useless and you can only scroll through each section to find what you’re looking for. I would solve this problem by freezing the header bar so it appears no matter what page you are on or where on the page you are. 

7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
	Accelerators -- unseen by the novice user -- may often speed up the interaction for the expert user so that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. 
	Allow users to tailor frequent actions. 

Evaluation (Rating: 2)
The website does not demonstrate this heuristic well because there is only one noticeable shortcut in the interactions. The header bars at the top of some pages allow experienced users to quickly navigate to the section they are interested in. However, the website does not provide any other shortcuts, and caters to only one type of user. I think a good additional feature is to give longtime users a list of their most frequent visited pages so they can easily access the features they use the most. 

8. Aesthetic and minimalist design 
	Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. 
	Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility. 

Evaluation (Rating: 3)
The website violates this heuristic because it includes so much information on one page and all the information is presented in a cluttered, disorganized format. The meditation pages include two columns of different-sized boxes, yet all the information is equally important, so the box size was simply to cram as much information in one page as possible. Each page has so many unnecessary competing colors that split the focus of the user. The video and audio clips are often lost because they are buried in the middle of the page. Finally, the flow of information is often interrupted by subscription notices and sign ups, which should be presented on their own separate page. I would work to make the website as minimal as possible by eliminating competing colors, getting rid of the subscription notices, and presenting more cohesive information on separate pages. 

9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors 
	Expressed in plain language (no codes)
	Precisely indicate the problem
	Constructively suggest a solution. 

Evaluation (No Issue)
It is difficult to make errors on this website, as most of the usage relates to clicking between pages or on audio and video clips. There is no need to present error messages or solutions when the user clicks on the wrong page because they can go back to the previous page easily. 


10. Help and documentation
	Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. 
	Help  information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large. 

Evaluation (Rating: 2)
The website violates this heuristic because the help features are presented infrequently and in obscure locations, and often on non-important pages. The only place where a help feature is located is at the bottom the “Directory” page, which is a strange place to look for help. It also only provides an email and phone number as contact information, and does not facilitate what help the user is looking for. I would change the help feature to look like an embedded email box so the user can type their issue immediately on the website without leaving the page.
